# 10X-Token
10X is an ERC20 smart contract in Solidity. More can be found here: http://10x.bz

Note: the project was cancelled before the ICO in August 2017. I decided that it was not worth risking the investor money on a project that would possibly not work as expected due to the lack of cooperation of the exchanges at the moment. (the project required to recyle part of the coins to the exchanges).

I decided then that Smart Contract was not the way to go, and started to workin on the Blockchain itself.
